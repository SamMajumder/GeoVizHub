# üåê GeoVizHub: Geospatial Data Visualization Repository
## üìå Description
GeoVizHub is a project aimed at creating, sharing, and exploring interactive geospatial data visualizations.

### üöÄ Projects
**1) Aerosol Odyssey** :  AerosolOdyssey is a fascinating journey through the absorbing aerosol index variations in New Delhi from November 2018 to August 2023. This project sheds light on the atmospheric aerosol dynamics over this period, offering a visual exploration of data to understand the environmental impacts and trends. Using interactive geospatial data visualizations, AerosolOdyssey provides a unique lens to observe and analyze aerosol concentrations and their temporal variations in New Delhi's atmosphere.
The Absorbing Aerosol Index (AAI) data was sourced from European Union/ESA/Copernicus dataset stored within the Google Earth Engine data (COPERNICUS/S5P/NRTI/L3_AER_AI) catalogue and the shapefile for Delhi boundaries was sourced from Data Meet India community (https://datameet.org/) (CC BY 4.0)

**2) Sundarban Shifts** : This project monitors vegetation changes in the Sundarbans Mangroves across Bangladesh and India, leveraging the MODIS MOD13A2 dataset. Aimed at understanding the ecological dynamics in the face of climate change, sea-level rise, and human activities, it analyses the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) to gauge vegetation health over time. Employing Python libraries for data visualization, the project presents an interactive geographical depiction of NDVI variations, encapsulating the essence of this unique ecosystem and the imperative of informed conservation strategies.
