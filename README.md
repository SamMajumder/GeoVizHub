# 🌐 GeoVizHub: Geospatial Data Visualization Repository
## 📌 Description
GeoVizHub is a project aimed at creating, sharing, and exploring interactive geospatial data visualizations. 

### 🚀 Projects 
**1) Aerosol Odyssey** :  AerosolOdyssey is a fascinating journey through the absorbing aerosol index variations in New Delhi from November 2018 to August 2023. This project sheds light on the atmospheric aerosol dynamics over this period, offering a visual exploration of data to understand the environmental impacts and trends. Using interactive geospatial data visualizations, AerosolOdyssey provides a unique lens to observe and analyze aerosol concentrations and their temporal variations in New Delhi's atmosphere. 
The Absorbing Aerosol Index (AAI) data was sourced from European Union/ESA/Copernicus dataset stored within the Google Earth Engine data (COPERNICUS/S5P/NRTI/L3_AER_AI) catalogue and the shapefile for Delhi boundaries was sourced from Data Meet India community (https://datameet.org/) (CC BY 4.0)
